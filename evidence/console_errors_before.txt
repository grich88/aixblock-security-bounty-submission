4. CENTRIFUGE SERVICE ERRORS:

   - Real-time messaging service unavailable

5. UI COMPONENT FAILURES:

   - Dropdown closing unexpectedly during user interaction
   - Navigation components failing to render

6. ROUTING ERRORS:
   - Default route "/" showing "Page not found"
   - React Router error boundaries triggered
   - Component tree recreation failures

7. VALIDATION ERRORS:
   - AJV validator strict mode warnings
   - JSON schema validation failures
   - Data structure mismatches

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
- Application completely non-functional
- Development environment unusable
- Multiple critical paths broken
- User interface inaccessible
- External service integrations failing
- Error cascade preventing recovery

These errors prevented any meaningful use of the platform and would have
made production deployment impossible.
